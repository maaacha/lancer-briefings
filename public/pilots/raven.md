I've been gone from home for a while now, what I've been told by the SCC is we're going on near-light travel towards the Rim. Mostly everyone I knew will be dead by the time I get there and the rest of them will be dead if I ever get back. I was destined to do great things, and show what my people are made of but the idea still messes with my mind that none of them will see me again. If I'm correct I will at least live in legend as an ancient warrior which warms me to the idea a little more of being out here but there's what feels like a deep spiritual and physical disconnection from my people that I can't shake.

Now instead of helping to maintain our mechanisms I pilot them, I've been ready for something like this for years and I'm glad my work in the Constellar Security was finally noticed. I'm a little unsure of my mission, but I'll certainly know when I get there.

ARID ENVIRONMENT ADAPTED HUMANS.

ADAPTIVE, RESILIENT, INTUITIVE.

The Arid Environment Adapted Humans are specialized to tackle Arid Environments such as Desert planets, Arid planets, and planets that generally experience extreme temperatures. However, this isn't the only thing that they're specialized in tackling.
