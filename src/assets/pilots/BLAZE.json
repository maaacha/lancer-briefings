Registeri- {Bzzzz....}</h1><h1>::// Union Navel Records Accessed.</h1><h1>::// Displaying file for: <em>Ensign</em> <em>Khloe Seo.</em></h1><hr><p><strong>Ensign Seo signed on with the Union Navy as soon as she was of the age to do so, a dream of hers according to our initial interview. Showing great promise during basic training, Seo displayed an affinity towards our Mechanized Corp during further aptitude testing. Upon completion of basic, she was given the rank of Marine and assigned to the ANNAMITE Line. Originally assigned to the Panther boarding squadron, Seo showed exceptional EVA handling and prowess during numerous operations. After review, it was decided that her talents would be more useful in ship-to-ship combat and she was promptly reassigned to ANNAMITE Line's Rapier Squadron with the new rank Ensign.<br><br>Since her reassignment, Seo has served our Union dutifully - though recent reports have shown that she has begun to act more recklessly on sorties, occasionally defying direct orders to act on her own intuition. While this has not become overtly problematic as of yet, it is recommended that Seo should be discouraged from acting out of line and reprimanded if more issues show up in after-action reports.</strong></p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":6,"background":"Starship Pilot","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"d6d05c4e-3184-40da-ba1d-dd166208fd35","name":"Days of Thunder","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":12,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Wed Jul 26 2023 20:05:10 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://d1nurxym97qk9o.cloudfront.net/public/us-east-1:ce1a1c65-7bb1-4fed-b560-1ecf722667cf/mech/Retrograde-Minis-GMS.png","loadouts":[{"id":"a304fd6d-afa7-451b-806e-37143ce56dd3","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_type_i_flight_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_pattern_a_smoke_charges","uses":3,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""}],"integratedSystems":[],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Main","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Main","weapon":{"id":"mw_assault_rifle","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
