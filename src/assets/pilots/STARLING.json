The NHP appears to be stable, the base neural pattern the NHP is cloned from was used in extensive battle simulations, aiding some of the unions best admirals and generals in various battles across union space. Union loyalty is extremely high, although as they progress through there cycle various fixations and elements have become commonplace. They've taken great enjoyment with transhumanist ideals and matters of identity, a concerning prospect given the nature of the project, being our first model it is essential to monitor Stelle and maintain a firm hand. Check in regularly to assure the neural pattern remains stable and in line with Union ideals. Overall, project seems promising thus far, the subject has scored above union veterans in piloting, and been an invaluable asset as a co-pilot, unit seems to have morale benefits as well, various troops and handelers have taken to calling her \"Stelle\" and given her the callsign \"Starling\" due to her cheery demeanor.</h2>","quirks":[],"current_hp":10,"background":"Mil-Spec Pilot","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"ce06b124-93fb-421b-b202-999fce303728","name":"Supernova","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_genghis","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":3,"boost":0,"current_hp":13,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Tue Aug 08 2023 04:52:55 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"0a519cca-b8d3-4bb4-9b9b-f8e85fce2744","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_explosive_vents","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"With the right tweaks, it becomes possible to dump excess heat into the area directly surrounding a chassis.
