The NHP appears to be stable, the base neural pattern the NHP is cloned from was used in extensive battle simulations, aiding some of the unions best admirals and generals in various battles across union space. Union loyalty is extremely high, although as they progress through there cycle various fixations and elements have become commonplace. They've taken great enjoyment with transhumanist ideals and matters of identity, a concerning prospect given the nature of the project, being our first model it is essential to monitor Stelle and maintain a firm hand. Check in regularly to assure the neural pattern remains stable and in line with Union ideals. Overall, project seems promising thus far, the subject has scored above union veterans in piloting, and been an invaluable asset as a co-pilot, unit seems to have morale benefits as well, various troops and handers have taken to calling her \"Stelle\" and given her the callsign \"Starling\" due to her cheery demeanor. </h2>","quirks":[],"current_hp":9,"background":"","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"eed2108c-774e-41a2-8cca-ac8a3a8c68e8","name":"Io","notes":"<p>Custom Paintjob/Personalizationm<br>The trans pride flag with</p><p>\"CASTIGATE THE</p><p>ENEMIES OF TRA\" is</p><p>written on your mech.<br><br><br>The cockpit of your mech</p><p>is a complete mess,</p><p>covered in wires, burnt out</p><p>CRTs, cans, etc.</p><p>Sometimes you find cool</p><p>stuff, though.</p>","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":16,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":6,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Wed Jul 26 2023 20:31:16 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"abb6eeb8-59d0-4420-aa0d-09cefd9efc57","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_eva_module","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_custom_paint_job","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_rapid_burst_jump_jet_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_armament_redundancy","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"By installing additional armor plating, redundant firing circuits, and enhanced insulation to magazines the longevity of a frame’s armaments can be greatly enhanced."}],"integratedSystems":[],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Main","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Main","weapon":{"id":"mw_assault_rifle","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
