## Lancer Royale

If the Promethean Collective wants to become more than just a group of shuttle-jumping, mech-riding renegaders, they're going to need a ship. No Lancer worth their salt catches rides for every mission.
They've got a few options here. They could 'commandeer', or 'find' a ship. Or, they could enter a locally advertised tournament, with the reward being a frigate. First, they'll have to find out some more details...

# Primary Objectives

- Find a way to acquire a ship.

# Secondary Objectives

- Win the Tournament.
- Steal a ship.
- Find another method.

# Stakes

- If the group can't find a ship soon, they're going to start running out of manna, and their reputation will take a hit.

# Reserves

- None at this time.
