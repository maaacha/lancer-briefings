> Tar Sharima is a periphery world marred by blood, violence and most recently warfare. The Trade Baronies have taken an interest in Tar Sharima for unknown reasons, and the extended warfare has lead to stresses on the planet that indicate it may undergo catastrophic collapse imminently. UNION needs eyes on the ground to determine why this planet is so important, if it's destruction can be averted, and who is responsible for it's current state.
