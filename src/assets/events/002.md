After a long, mostly uneventful journey through the **LONG RIM**, all the relevant parties finally arrive in Iskander. **RAVEN** appears to have gotten there first, having enough time to find her legs in the system and situate herself with her preferred employer. **BLAZE** and **STARLING** have only just exited near-space, and look to make contact with the name provided with them, as well as figure out what's what in the system of Iskander.

As for **FAE**? Well, I'm sure she has her own plans...

Several data transits are made to a handful of skilled individuals, recommending they move to the Iskander system no matter the time needed. Not just our key players, but others also begin travelling to this strange inbetween land.
