Steel and Flesh: The 75th Welcomes Its Newest Pilots

In the cold light of Orbital Facility 2275’s orbital dawn, fifty-seven cadets stood at attention beside their gleaming mechs — chassis of every make and model, their hulls painted in the stark whites and reds of the Union Naval Department. The air was electric with ceremony, but beneath the polished metal and practiced salutes lingered something heavier: the weight of history, of politics, and of the quiet fear that every new Lancer learns to swallow.

Today, the 75th Mechanized Chassis Regiment — a name that carries both distinction and controversy — welcomes a new class of pilots into its ranks. The regiment’s reputation was forged on the frontier worlds of the Dawnline Shore, where it gained notoriety for decisive but devastating interventions. For some, the 75th embodies the best of Union’s military machine — disciplined, adaptive, and unflinching. For others, it represents the creeping militarization of a bureaucracy that once promised post-scarcity peace.

Among the new graduates is Cadet-Major Eno Javek, now Lieutenant Javek, who addressed the assembly in words that teetered between pride and caution.

“We are told we are the future — the hands of humanity’s will. But a hand can heal or strike. Our duty is to remember which one we are.”

That sentiment, noble as it sounds, may soon be tested. The 75th’s deployment orders — classified, but quietly confirmed by several Naval Department insiders — suggest that the regiment’s mission is to “stabilize” the Tar Sharima region, a euphemism that, in past campaigns, has meant direct intervention. The presence of Karrakin corporate assets on the ground complicates matters further; Union and the Baronies have long maintained a precarious détente, one that could fracture if either side’s forces are seen as overstepping.

The cadets’ graduation, then, feels less like a celebration and more like a quiet mobilization. Their mechs, though gleaming today, will soon be dusted with alien sand and scored by railgun fire.

As the anthem faded and the graduates dispersed to their hangars, one could almost believe Union’s endless machinery — political, industrial, human — was working perfectly. But for those who have seen too many “perfect” systems fail, the 75th’s march forward serves as a reminder: in the age of Lancers, the line between protector and oppressor remains perilously thin, and it is drawn in steel.
