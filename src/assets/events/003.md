Deep Reach Dynamics experts report that a prieviously undocumented astrological body has been discovered in the Iskander system. Tenatively named Arcadia by the scientist who first observed it's existence, current hypothesis' indicate that the dwarf planet's strange orbit is the reason it was not documented until recently. Deep Reach Dynamics claim that in the coming years, they will be preparing and sending out research teams to test the astrological body and determine the cause of it's orbit, as well as it's icey nature. Scientists claim that, while ice planets are not uncommon, the intense heat let off by Iskander, the white dwarf at the center of the system, should have 'thawed out' the planet centuries ago.
